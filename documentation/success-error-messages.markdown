# Overwrite the default success / error messages

For the actions new, edit, delete, you can overwrite the default notice message to set your own:

{% highlight yaml %}
edit:
  params:
    messages:
      success: "Your movie is well updated"
      error: "Oops, an error occurred, and we cannot save this movie."
{% endhighlight %}

Assuming you have autogenerated fields in your form, an API key for instance, you may want to show it in the notice in order to get a feedback to your user.
Configure your message as below where `$Model` is your model short name object:

{% highlight yaml %}

edit:
  params:
    messages:
      success: "You've just registered a new application, thanks. Your consumer key is <u>{$Model->getApiKey()}</u>."
{% endhighlight %}

**Warning**<br />Don't forget the curly brackets `{$Model->getWhatever()}`.
